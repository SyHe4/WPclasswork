WPclasswork
I am a computer science major. The courses I have taken at New Paltz are computer science one through three, assembly language and computer architecture, object oriented programming, language processing, and discrete mathematics for computing. In high school I took java and javascript courses. Much of my programming experience has been gained through projects for my classes. One program I have written that stood out to me was a rhythm game. Points were awarded for hitting the correct button prompts on time, while incorrect timing or button presses earned negative points. Due to time constraints and inexperience it was not very polished, but it stood out to me because it was an ambitious project.

I see myself having multiple uses for what we will learn in this course. This class will aid me in other classes that I am currently taking, such as software engineering, and the ones I will take in the future. Additionally, the knowledge from this class could possibly help in my future career. This course will also give me experience with programs I have not used before which could be useful for future jobs.
